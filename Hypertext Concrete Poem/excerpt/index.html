                On and on the Yangtse rolls and sweeps to the east,
Its waves have washed away great men and heroes.
Right or wrong, gain or loss, all come to naught, O!
The green mountains are still there,
Sometimes tinged red in the sunset glow.

Grey-haired fishers and woodcutters in the islets
Are used to seeing th' moon rise and th' spring breeze blow.
A jolly gathering, a pot of coarse brew, though:
Events past and present
All serve for their chats and jokes.
